A custom controller for guitar hero

## Inspiration

One of my favorite rythm games is guitar hero.
Being the only one in my family to make it past medium difficulty, I had a soft spot in my heart for the game.
It's easy to like things you're good at.

## What is it?

It's a custom guitar hero controller that looks like a real guitar (a les paul to be exact).
Featuring low profile mechanical switches and a teensy microcontroller for a brain.

The body and neck is designed in OpenSCAD, so it's quite customizable. 

Of course, a device that just is a guitar hero controller isn't useful, so there's a switch that enables midi mode.

All in, it cost about $x to make.

## Can I make my own?

Sure- laser cutter files, schematics, and code are provided.
Everything is open sourced.

## Can you make me a kit?

Mayyybe. If there's enough demand I'll throw it up on Tindie (with CNC cut based instead of laser cut)
